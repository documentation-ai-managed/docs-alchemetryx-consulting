## Overview

Alchemetryx Consulting partners with owner-led small and mid-sized businesses to bring structure, clarity, and control to your operations. You fix broken workflows, reduce manual dependencies, and build simple, reliable systems that scale with your growth. Most businesses struggle not from lack of effort, but from scattered operations, manual follow-ups, finances, and decision-making overly reliant on the owner. Alchemetryx identifies leaks in time, money, and energy, then designs practical systems to eliminate chaos and make growth predictable.

    Fix broken processes that waste hours daily. You map current workflows, identify pain points, and implement streamlined automations.

    For example, automate client onboarding:

    ```javascript
    // Simple Zapier-like automation script (Node.js example)
    const onboardingWorkflow = async (newClient) => {
      await sendWelcomeEmail(newClient.email);
      await createProjectTask(newClient.id);
      await notifyTeam(newClient.name);
      console.log(`Onboarding complete for ${newClient.name}`);
    };

    df = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv')
    monthly_summary = df.groupby('month')['amount'].sum()
